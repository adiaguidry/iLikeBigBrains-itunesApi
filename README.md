# iLikeBigBrains-itunesApi

### Hackathon API project
- This was a four person group Hackthon project. We had to use an API and build something useful. We used the iTunes API to make a fun book website. It features top 10 books in 4 categories.


### What I plan on adding to this project
- Add more CSS 
- Add another API (twitter)
